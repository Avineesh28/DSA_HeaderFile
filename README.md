# Data Structures and Algorithms Header Files

This repository contains header files implementing essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C and C++. These files serve as fundamental building blocks for various applications, providing efficient solutions for common computational problems.

## File Descriptions:

### 1. **DSA-BST.h** - Binary Search Tree

`DSA-BST.h` provides the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C. BST is a versatile data structure that supports efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of elements.

### 2. **DSA-BST.h.gch**

`DSA-BST.h.gch` is the precompiled header file for the Binary Search Tree header file. It is generated by the compiler for optimization purposes.

### 3. **DSA-BSTMain.c**

`DSA-BSTMain.c` is a C source file demonstrating the usage of the Binary Search Tree implemented in `DSA-BST.h`. It contains sample code showcasing various BST operations.

### 4. **DSA-CLL.h** - Circular Linked List

`DSA-CLL.h` provides the implementation of a Circular Linked List (CLL) in C++. Circular Linked Lists are variations of linked lists where the last node points back to the first node, creating a loop.

### 5. **DSA-CLLMain.cpp**

`DSA-CLLMain.cpp` is a C++ source file demonstrating the usage of the Circular Linked List implemented in `DSA-CLL.h`. It contains sample code showcasing various CLL operations.

### 6. **DSA.h.gch**

`DSA.h.gch` is the precompiled header file for general DSA utilities. It is generated by the compiler for optimization purposes.

## How to Use:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
   - Include `DSA-BST.h` in your C program.
   - Utilize the functions provided in `DSA-BST.h` for BST operations.

   Example:
   ```c
   #include "DSA-BST.h"

   int main() {
       // Your BST operations here
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Circular Linked List (CLL):**
   - Include `DSA-CLL.h` in your C++ program.
   - Utilize the classes and functions provided in `DSA-CLL.h` for CLL operations.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   #include "DSA-CLL.h"

   int main() {
       // Your CLL operations here
       return 0;
   }
   ```

Feel free to explore and modify these header files to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding!
